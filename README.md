## Contact App

The Contact App is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to display and manage contact information in a simple, elegant, and organized interface. The app features two main screens, a contacts overview page showing both recent and all contacts, and a details page displaying full information when a contact is selected.

# About the Project

This project was developed as part of a personal learning initiative to strengthen skills in Flutter and UI design.
The goal was to build a clean and responsive contact management app that demonstrates the use of Flutter widgets, navigation, and data organization through grouping and list management.

It also serves as a practical example for beginners learning how to structure multi-page Flutter apps and handle data passing between screens.

# Features

Recent Contacts: Displays a list of recently accessed contacts.

All Contacts: Organized and grouped alphabetically for easy browsing.

Contact Details View: Shows detailed information about a selected contact.

Clean UI: Built with Flutter widgets for a smooth and responsive interface.

Scalable Design: Ready for extension to include new features such as search, favorites, or contact editing.
